# Higher or Lower Number Game

This is a simple console-based **Higher or Lower** game written in Python.

The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.  
Your task is to guess whether the next number will be **higher** or **lower** than the current one.

If your guess is correct, your score increases and the game continues.  
If your guess is wrong, the game ends and your final score is displayed.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the script is located:
   ```bash
   cd higher_lower_game
